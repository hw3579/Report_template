The main purpose of this experiment is to investigate the operation and characteristics of three different
types of flowmeter: venture meter, orifice plate meter and variable area meter.
By researching the experimental data of these three flow meters at different water pressures, 
the energy loss of the water flowing through the meters was determined.
