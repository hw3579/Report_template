\subsection{Regression analysis}
\subsubsection{ExperimentA1}
Plot a scatter chart with $\sqrt{gh}$ as the horizontal coordinate 
and x as the vertical coordinate based on the data from Table \ref{t1}.
And a regression analysis and linear fit was performed on the data, 
as shown in \autoref{ExperimentA1} and results in \autoref{table4}.

\end{table}

Take the average of 
the data and take it into equation \eqref{6} to get $C_v=\frac{slope}{2}$.
The final $C_v$ is 0.955.

\subsubsection{ExperimentA2}
Plot a scatter chart with $\sqrt{h}$ as the horizontal coordinate 
and Q as the vertical coordinate based on the data from Table \ref{t1}.
And a regression analysis and linear fit was performed on the data, as shown in \autoref{ExperimentA2}
and results in \autoref{table5}

    \begin{tabular}{l|ll}
    \hline
        & Slope    & R-square \\ \hline
    3mm & 0.00001924 & 0.9955   \\
    6mm & 0.0001103 & 0.9811   \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{result of A2 regression analysis}
    \label{table5}
    \end{table}


Use equation \eqref{14} to caculate the $C_d=\frac{Slope}{A_0\sqrt{2g}}$
and the final $C_d$ is 0.615 (3mm)
and 0.8816 (6mm)

\subsection{Error analysis}

$\bullet$ Inaccurate recording of water trajectory to the sheet 
due to not looking horizontally at the top point of the needle.

$\bullet$ Inaccurate calculation of the flow rate due to residual 
water in the measuring cylinder.

$\bullet$ When calculating the flow rate, errors caused by the stopwatch timing not being fully 
synchronised with the water collection time.
