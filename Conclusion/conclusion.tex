\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
From the results of the regression analysis, 
the R-square value of $Q_v$ $Q_o$ is equal to 1, and the $Q_a$ is very close to 1,
which demonstrates a strong linear correlation between the x and y axes.
Therefore, the data from the regression analysis is valid.

However, there is a large error between the actual measured data 
and the theoretical data. Theoretically, the slope is $Q_o>Q_v>Q_a$. For the height of the line, $Q_a>Q_o>Q_v$.
For the actual measured slope, $Q_v>Q_o>Q_a$, 
and there are lines intersecting and $Q_v$ and $Q_o$ exceed $Q_a$ in the later data.

In conclusion, the measured experimental data had a very strong linear correlation, 
demonstrating that the experiments were performed correctly.
Comparison with the theoretical figure, 
It can speculate that the experimental error is not human-caused, 
but more likely to be an error in the experimental apparatus itself.
