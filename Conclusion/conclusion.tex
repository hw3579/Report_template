\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
From the results of the regression analysis, 
the R-square value of $Q_v$ $Q_o$ is equal to 1, and the $Q_a$ is very close to 1,
which demonstrates a strong linear correlation between the x and y axes.
Therefore, the data from the regression analysis is valid.

However, there is a large error between the actual measured data 
and the theoretical data. Theoretically, the slope is $Q_o>Q_v>Q_a$. For the height of the line, $Q_a>Q_o>Q_v$.
For the actual measured slope, $Q_v>Q_o>Q_a$, 
and there are lines intersecting and $Q_v$ and $Q_o$ exceed $Q_a$ in the later data.

In error analysis, The average error for all three different flowmeters is less than 10\%.
But, it is noticed that the error is a little large at the variable area in the first set of data. 
A new experiment could be considered to obtain more accurate results.

In conclusion, the measured experimental data had a very strong linear correlation, 
demonstrating that the experiments were performed correctly. Comparison with the theoretical figure, 
It can be obtained that the experimental error is not caused by human beings.
Rather, it is an error in the experimental apparatus itself.
