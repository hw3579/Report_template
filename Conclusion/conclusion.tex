\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
From the results of the regression analysis, 
the R-square value of $Q_v$ $Q_o$ is equal to 1, and the $Q_a$ is very close to 1,
which demonstrates a strong linear correlation between the x and y axes.
Therefore, the data from the regression analysis is valid.
