\section{Method}

As can be seen above,  
It need to measure the difference in head between 1 and 2.

The head difference between 1 and 2 can be easily measured by tools such as a ruler.
For the trajectory of the water jet of 2, 
adjusting the needle mounted on the back plate so that its bottom point is as close as possible 
to the upper edge of the jet, and tighten the screws.

Next, attach a sheet 
of paper to the back-board between the needle and board,
and make sure it is horizontal and secure.

As you can see in the \autoref{fig:demo},
Set up the same coordinate system on the attachment sheet, 
and then measure the x and y distance between each marker point to get table 
\autoref{table:1}.

In order to ensure the accuracy of the data, 
four data sets were measured by using two different orifice diameters and 
two different heights.

The data is shown in the following table.

In experiment A2, a measuring cylinder is a good tool to measure the flow rate of water. 
First, prepare an empty measuring cylinder and collect the water jet from 2 places. 
When the measuring cylinder starts to receive water, press the stopwatch to start timing. 
Wait for a period of time until the measuring cylinder exceeds 800 ml, 
then stop collecting water and stop timing.
