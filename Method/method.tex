\section{Method}
In this experiment, a pressure tube was installed at each of the flowmeter.
Starting the pump, adjusting the flow rate so that the scale on the variable area was 5,
and recording the water pressure data for the 8 different pressure tubes.
Finally, the actual flow rate was measured by using a stopwatch and a measuring cylinder.
Then, open the inlet of the water reservoir under the lab bench and measure the time it takes to store 5 litres of water.

Repeat the experiment, controlling the scale on the variable area to 10,15,20. Record the data.
