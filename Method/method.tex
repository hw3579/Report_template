\section{Method}

As can be seen above, in order to derive Bernoulli's equation, 
we need to measure the difference in head between 1 and 2, 
the jet velocity of 2 and the real flow rate of water.

The head difference between 1 and 2 can be easily measured by tools such as a ruler.
For the velocity of the water jet of 2, It can be used by the trajectory measurement method. 
Adjusting the needle mounted on the back plate so that its bottom point is as close as possible 
to the upper edge of the jet, and tighten the screws.

Next, attach a sheet 
of paper to the back-board between the needle and board,
and make sure it is horizontal and secure.

As you can see in the \autoref{fig:demo},
Set up the same coordinate system on the attachment sheet, 
and then measure the x and y distance between each marker point to get table 
%a1.
